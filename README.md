👋 Hi, I’m Juha

I’m an aspiring web developer who learns best by building things, breaking them, and fixing them again. I enjoy turning ideas into working applications and steadily improving my skills one project at a time.

💻 Tech I work with:
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, PHP, Laravel, REST APIs

🚀 Currently focused on:
Deepening my React skills, working with APIs, and writing cleaner, more maintainable code.

🛠️ Projects:
From a personal portfolio to React and Laravel apps, plus smaller JavaScript projects for practice.

🎯 Goal:
Grow into a confident full-stack developer and build a portfolio I’m proud of.
