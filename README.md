👋 Hi, I’m Juha!

I’m an aspiring web developer who learns by building real projects and improving them one commit at a time. I enjoy turning ideas into working applications and refining my code until it’s cleaner than the last version.

💻 Tech stack:
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, PHP, Laravel, REST APIs

🚀 Currently focused on:
React fundamentals, API integration, and writing code that’s readable, maintainable, and doesn’t surprise me later.

🛠️ What I build:
Personal projects, React & Laravel apps, and smaller experiments to sharpen logic and UI skills.

🎯 Goal:
Grow into a confident full-stack developer and build software I’m genuinely proud to ship.
